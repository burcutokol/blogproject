* In this project, a book archive website is developed using ASP.NET Web Forms. The database is created in Microsoft SQL Management Studio and integrated into the project using ADO.NET Entity Model.
* Two different main pages, "Admin" and "User," are designed based on a Bootstrap template.
* The "User" page allows users to save books they like, make comments, and access different sections, while the "Admin" page allows the website administrator to add and edit blogs, manage comments, and view some website statistics.
* LINQ queries are used to retrieve data and save user input into the Entity Model.
